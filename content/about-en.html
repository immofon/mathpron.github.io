<p>Currently, this project contains {{stat|entries}} entries.</p><h2>How to contribute</h2><p>This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, which means that it is impossible to edit the entries directly on this site. You can go to {{link|https://github.com/mathpron/mathpron.github.io|GitHub page}} for this project, to report errors and to suggest new entries.</p><h2>Audio</h2><p>Most of the samples are generated by speech synthesis software. Sometimes I use samples from {{link|https://forvo.com/|Forvo}}, but AI is often better at producing clear and consistent pronunciations. Of course, AI often mispronounce the names of mathematicians and produce artifacts, which require manual editing to remove.</p><p>Please note that audio clips and their narrow phonetic transcriptions sometimes have tiny differences, as the latter are supposed to represent typical realizations, but every single utterance of the same phrase, even by the same person, will not be completely identical.</p><h2>Sources</h2><p>A pronunciation can be verified using either a dictionary, or a recording on Forvo. Many languages are consistent in spelling, so the pronunciation can be deduced from the spelling and the position of stress. If none of the above ways work, I make my best guess based on AI’s pronunciation, and leave a “verification needed” tag beside it.</p><p>For English pronunciations of foreign names, I have no reliable sources at all. English dictionaries often disagree with each other on the pronunciation of these names. I am sure that I have made many mistakes, and please feel free to correct them.</p><h2>Licensing</h2><p>The contents of this project are licensed under {{link|https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/|CC BY-SA 4.0}}.
